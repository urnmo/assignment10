<!--Use a Jeopardy question API to make a simple quiz game.

Ahh the internet. There's a person who actually maintains a Jeopardy question database and makes it available via API. You can make GET requests to http://jservice.io/api/random to get a random Jeopardy question.

Create a quiz game that shows one random question at a time and allows the user to answer it. If they answer correctly, you should make some sort of change to the DOM to indicate that (green background color, show some text that says "correct!", play a bell ding sound, etc). If they answer incorrectly, you should make a different change. After an attempt you should also change the question to another random question from the API.

Only one question should ever be visible at a time. Users should be able to answer the question via a text box with a 'guess' button. You must show the question but feel free to show category information as well if you want to.

Hard mode

Keep track of score. There's a property called value that indicates how many points the question was worth in Jeopardy that you can use for assigning the value of each question.-->
